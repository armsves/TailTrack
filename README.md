# TailTrack - Monitor your pets 24 hours a day to avoid health problems

TailTrack is a computer vision project to track the activities of any pets, the main reason to build it is because I have 6 cats that are mostly alone when I travel, when I travel I can´´t be paying as much attention as I would like. 
This is not the only use, it can also be used for cat shelters or colonies, veterinary clinics and many other places where your pet might be alone or needed extra attention.
